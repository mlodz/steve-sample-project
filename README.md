# This is a practice project to setup Node + Express + React

## Setup

Start with `npm install`.

Run `npm start` to start both the the react dev server and express backend in watch mode.

Make sure there are no errors (for example, yarn not installed). 

Both the Node server and front-end servers should be running.

Run tests with `npm test`; run and open coverage report with `npm run coverage:open`.

## Code Locations

Setup node api endpoints in `src/lib/api/`.

Update Express routes in `src/express-server.js`.

Modify the base html file in `src/assets/base.html`.

Add static public files in `src/assets/`.
